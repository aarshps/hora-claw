  "version": "1.2.3",
  "highlights": [
    "Shifted greeting voice fully to personal-claw language and removed project-framed phrasing like \"our project today\" in normalized responses.",
    "Refined the system persona prompt to keep replies warm and human while avoiding agent/bot/project framing unless the user explicitly asks for it.",
    "Kept strict --yolo mode and robust Gemini output handling introduced in v1.2.2 for stable conversational responses."
