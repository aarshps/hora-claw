  "highlights": [
    "Fixed repeated YOLO banner failures by forcing GEMINI_SANDBOX=false for Hora-claw Gemini calls unless explicitly overridden.",
    "Kept strict --yolo mode and improved Gemini output parsing/noise filtering so users no longer see banner text as the main error.",
    "Improved shutdown reliability with bounded Telegram send timeouts and forced-exit protection to prevent stuck processes after Ctrl+C.",
    "Updated npm start to run without bot.log redirection locks; optional logging remains available via npm run start:log."
